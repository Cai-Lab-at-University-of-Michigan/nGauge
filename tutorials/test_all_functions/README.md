# All Function Test

In this folder, we have a script which automatically tests all functions available in the `Neuron` class for it's output
this can be used both as a way for the nGauge installation to be tested and as a way to perform regression testing between
versions.

## To Run
To run the jupyter notebook, you can simply start Jupyter and run all cells. It is also possible to run it from a commandline
using the wonderful `Papermill` utility that runs Jupyter notebooks as batch scripts.
