# Comparison Figure Overview

This tutorial contains the code required to make Figure 4 from the manuscript.
Most of the code is in the `build_fig_rev2.ipynb` file, which outputs 4 PDF files
(`PanelA-C.pdf` and `PanelOverview.pdf`).

Also included in this folder are the public data used to generate the figure and the outputs
from running three chosen commands in Lmeasure as `txt` files (and example command line parameters
used in `Lmin.txt`).

After running this code, the PDFs were then composited together in Adobe Illustrator.
